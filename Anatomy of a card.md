Most cards follow the same general structure, however, [[Mech]] cards do not. Their structure will be noted later in this section. 

## Regular Cards
![[example-card.png|300]]
(figure a: an example card.)
### A: Scrap to play
This field tells you how much scrap it costs to play this card.
Cards that don't cost scrap (e.g. action cards) will have a 0 in this field.
### B: Card Type
{Playtest} This field will have one of the following values:
* !: Action
* @: Part
* $: Crew
### C: Energy to Activate
This field tells you how much energy from your mech core this card costs to activate. 
### D: Durability
This field tells you how much Durability this card has when it is played. (Hint: it's sized so you can place a single six-sided die on it to keep track.)
Cards that don't have durability (e.g. Crew and Actions) don't have this field at all.

### Type line
This field contains the types of the card. Some examples of lines you may see here are:
* Scrapper - Energy Weapon: This is a weapon part that can only be attached to mechs with the "Scrapper" keyword, and when it attacks, it deals Energy damage, which is referenced by some card effects.
* Assistant: This is a special kind of crew card of which you can only have one in play at a time. If you play another crew card with the Assistant type, your existing assistant will betray you and be sent to the junk pile.
### Limit
This field is only relevant when playing in a tournament. During constructed tournament play, you cannot have more copies of a card with limit than its limit rating in your deck. 

## Mech Cards

### A: Energy Capacity
This field tells you how much energy your mech can supply each turn. This places an effective upper-limit on the number of parts you can have active on any given turn.
### B: Scrap per Turn
This field tells you how much scrap you will gain at the start of the [[Build]] phase. 
### C: Integrity
This field tells you how much integrity your mech has at the start of the game. (Hint: this field is sized so you can place two six-sided dice on it to keep track)
### Others
All other fields on a Mech card are identical to the ones on a normal card.
