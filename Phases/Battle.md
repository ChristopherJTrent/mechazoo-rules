At the beginning of the battle phase, the Active Player selects a weapon part they control, and uses one of its abilities to attack a [[Part]] on the opponent's mech. This attack goes onto [[The Heap]]. 
Once that attack takes effect, the Non-Active Player takes a turn in the same manner, and players alternate until neither player elects to make an attack. 

#### What if my opponent doesn't have any parts?
This is the only situation in which you can directly attack your opponent's mech. Any attack, no matter how large, will deal exactly 1 point of damage to a mech's integrity. 
> *small* mechs start at 2 stories tall, you're not dealing significant superstructure damage to them in a single hit no matter how big and spooky your attack is.
