The play area consists of 13 zones:
* The Scrapheap
* The Junk Pile
* The Slag Pit
* 5 [[Part]] Zones
* 5 [[Crew]] zones

A standard game setup will have the Scrapheap at the bottom left of a player's playmat, with the Junk Pile above that, and the Slag Pit above the Junk Pile.
The 5 Crew zones line the bottom of the playmat, with each Part zone going above a Crew zone.
