The play area consists of 13 zones:
* The Scrapheap
* The Junk Pile
* The Slag Pit
* 5 [[Part]] Zones
* 5 [[Crew]] zones
* The [[Mech]] zone

A standard game setup will have the Scrapheap at the bottom left or bottom right of a player's playmat, with the Junk Pile above that, and the Slag Pit above the Junk Pile.
The 5 Crew zones line the remainder of the bottom of the playmat, with each Part zone going above a Crew zone.
The Mech zone goes opposite the Junk Pile on the playmat.
